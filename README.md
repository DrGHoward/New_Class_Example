### Investment Management in Fintech

**Overview and Orgin** 
* "The Vangaurd Group" was founded on May 1, 1975 By Mr. Jack Bogle. The idea for The Vanguard Group came about when the Founder, Jack Bogle was fired from his position with the Wellington Management Company. The company is owned by its funds, which are then owned by its sharehoders. This makes the shareholders the real owners of the company and there are no outside investors. The Vanguard Group's initial public offering only generated 11 million dollars, which appreciated to 17 million dollars during their first year. Despite this, in 1990, The Vangaurd Group became and is still the largest mutual fund provider in the world.

**Business Activities**
* The Vanguard Group is trying to simplify investing for its clients. They have have stood for low-cost, uncomplicated investing ever since their inception in 1975. Vanguard believes that an investment company should manage its funds solely in the interests of its clients. Vanguard has a deep history of active management, having managed active funds since their beginning.Their purpose is to take a stand for all investors, to treat them fairly, and to give them the best chance for investment success
* Vanguard was built exclusively for buy and hold investors who may not need robust charting capabilities or expansive research tools and data in order to make investment decisions. Vanguard excels at low cost investing, making it ideal for long-term buy and hold investors and retirement savers. Vanguard is best suited for long-term or retirement savers, investors who prefer low-cost investment vehicles, and investors who are comfortable investing primarily through index funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs). Vanguard has more than 30 million investors and $7.2 trillion in global assets under management as of January 2021
* Vanguard was built to serve buy and hold investors with a long-term philosophy, providing an intuitive, educational, and low-cost brokerage experience for this group. By removing outside owners and outside interests, there are no competing loyalties. Vanguard is committed to making advice more accessible and affordable and to keeping fees low so that investors can ralize more gains.
* The Vanguard group currently utilizes the Vanguard Digital Advisor. The Vanguard Digital Advisor is an designed for younger investors, which compliments its Personal Advisor Services that provides access to financial advisors for clients with more complex financial situations. The Robo advisor is an online platform that manages their clients investments automatically. It is financial advice that comes from an algorythim, instead of a person.The Robo Advisor will ask for basic information about your goals, risk tolerance, and the lenght of time that you want to stay invested. The technology then takes over; it does the actual investing, it manages and rebalences periodically to make sure that your asset mix stays on track.

## Landscape:
* The Vanguard Group is in the financial industry domain of investment or asset management. The major trends and innovations in the investment management domain  over the last 5-10 years include investing in digital assests, passively managed funds, the impact of emerging technology, digital transformation, cyber security and risk, and machine learning and artificial intelligence. Other major companies in this domain include BlackRock, Fidelity, Morgan Stanley, JPMorgan Chase, UBS Group and Goldman Sachs.

## Results:
* Vanguard has left its mark in the investment management domain. Vanguard mutual funds have brand-name recognition. The 40-plus-year-old company's mutual funds and exchange-traded funds have long been a mainstay in 401(k)s, pension plans, IRAs and managed portfolios of today. Vanguard also offers its investors more Choices, low fees, and competitive long-term returns.

* Some of the core metrics that companies in this domain use to measure success include:
       -Assets Under Management (AUM) per Employee.
       -Client Retention Rate.
       -Clients per Registered Financial Advisor.
       -Account On-Boarding Cycle Time.
       -Trade Error Rate (by Asset Class/Type)
       -Trade Settlements per Back Office Employee.
Given Vanguards industry standing, they are outperforming many of their competitors in this domain. The actual figures on these metrics were not readily available. Vanguard Group is the second-largest investment firm in the world, after BlackRock. It is the biggest issuer of mutual funds worldwide and the second-biggest issuer of ETFs.



## Recomendations:
* A recomendation theat I have for Vanguard is to offer tools and platforms for their customers to actively trade stocks. although this runs counterintuitive to thier investment philososphy, more people are investing online everyday, and many of them would benifit from this added feature.
to incorporate this additional feature, live chats and chatbots could be used to help assist their customers. Also, data and educational materials could be added to their online platform. These technologies seem appropriate for our solutions because by harnessing the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning on their platforms, they could accommodate the additional volume of trading without the added burdon of human labor.
